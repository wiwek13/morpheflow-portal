## 🚦 New User? Start Here in 3 Steps

MorpheFlow gives you a personal, automated Android patching studio that compiles your favorite apps (YouTube ReVanced, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) with custom patches and keeps them updated automatically on your phone.

### Choose Your Path:
| Path | Best For | Requirement | Experience |
|---|---|---|---|
| **🌐 Path 1: Cloudflare Edge (Recommended)** | Most users | Free Cloudflare + Free GitHub | Zero server costs, zero VPS, personal web dashboard + cloud builder |
| **🏠 Path 2: Homelab / Docker** | Self-hosters | Docker / Linux / Unraid | Local FastAPI server on `:8080` with background workers |
| **📱 Path 3: Android Obtainium Client** | Mobile install & updates | Android phone | 1-Click sync into Obtainium for background APK auto-updates |

---

### ⚡ 3-Minute Quickstart (Path 1 · Free Serverless Cloud)

1. **Clone this repository & run the deployer**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal.git
   cd morpheflow-portal
   ./deploy.sh          # macOS / Linux (or .\deploy.ps1 on Windows)
   ```
   *The script automatically provisions your free Cloudflare D1 database, configures a private GitHub builder repository for your releases, deploys the edge portal, and prints your master password.*

2. **Open your web dashboard & patch any app**:
   - Navigate to `https://morpheflow.<subdomain>.workers.dev` and log in.
   - **Upload & Patch**: Drag-and-drop any base `.apk` or paste a direct download URL directly from the Home screen.
   - **Or Provision from Catalog**: Select from 1,354+ community apps (YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, etc.) with automated conflict linting.
   - Hit **Run Pipeline** — your GitHub Actions runner compiles and signs the APK in ~2-3 minutes.

3. **Install & auto-update on your phone**:
   - Open your dashboard on your phone and tap **1-Click Sync to Obtainium**.
   - Your device installs the clean, VirusTotal-audited APK and checks for automatic background updates!

## 🚀 Quick Start & Deployment

MorpheFlow ships two runtimes: **Cloudflare Workers (serverless edge)** and the **self-hosted backend** (FastAPI on `:8080`).
Pick the self-hosted install format that fits your machine:

| Format | Best for | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | Homelab (Unraid/Proxmox/TrueNAS), Oracle VPS | `docker compose -f default_compose.yaml up -d` |
| 1-line installer | Fastest bare-metal / VPS setup | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal/main/install.sh \| bash` |
| `.deb` / `.rpm` | Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL with `systemd` | download from [Releases](https://github.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal/releases), `sudo apt install ./morpheflow_*_amd64.deb` |
| AUR (`morpheflow-git`) | Arch Linux / CachyOS / EndeavourOS | `yay -S morpheflow-git` ([AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/morpheflow-git)) |
| AppImage | Portable run without install (x86_64) | download `MorpheFlow-*-x86_64.AppImage`, `chmod +x` and run |

> Note: native packages (`.deb`/`.rpm`/AppImage/1-liner) install the **self-hosted backend**.
> The Cloudflare Workers edge portal is deployed separately via `./deploy.sh` below.

### Method 1: Cloudflare Workers (Recommended · 100% Free · Zero VPS)

Deploy the entire serverless portal and configure the cloud runner in under 2 minutes:

#### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+) & **npm**
- **Cloudflare Wrangler CLI**: Run `npx wrangler login` to authorize your Cloudflare account.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Run `gh auth login` to authorize private repo linking and GitHub Actions automation.

#### 2. Run the 1-Click Deployer
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal.git
cd morpheflow-portal

# Run the automated deployer
./deploy.sh          # macOS / Linux
.\deploy.ps1         # Windows PowerShell
```
*(Or execute `npm run deploy`)*

The script automatically:
1. Verifies Cloudflare and GitHub CLI credentials.
2. Creates or connects your Cloudflare D1 database (`morpheflow-db`) and pins the UUID into `wrangler.toml`.
3. Applies database schema migrations atomically.
4. Generates a secure, random single-user master password.
5. Deploys the edge worker and static assets to `https://morpheflow.<subdomain>.workers.dev`.
6. Sets up your private GitHub Actions cloud builder and synchronizes secrets (`CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

---

### Method 2: Docker Compose (Self-Hosted Server / Homelab)

If you prefer self-hosting on your own homelab (Unraid, Proxmox, TrueNAS) or an Oracle Cloud Always Free VPS:

1. **Clone & Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal.git
   cd morpheflow-portal
   cp example.env .env
   ```
2. **Configure Remote Access & Tunnels**:
   Edit `.env` to configure your preferred tunnel ([Pangolin, Tailscale Funnel, or Cloudflare](docs/tunnels.md)) and email notification settings.
3. **Start the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Access your portal at `http://localhost:8080` (or via your configured tunnel).

### Method 3: Native packages — `.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage, 1-line installer

Native packages install the same self-hosted backend as Docker, but as a `systemd` service
(`morpheflow.service` → `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) instead of a container. Requires Python 3.11+
and Java 21 (declared as package dependencies and checked at install time).

**Option A — 1-line installer** (installs Docker Compose setup by default):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal/main/install.sh | bash
# variants:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --native    # .deb/.rpm + systemd service
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiwek13/morpheflow-portal/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --appimage   # portable AppImage
```

**Option B — `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu)**:

```bash
# From the Releases page (tagged builds attach .deb/.rpm/AppImage automatically):
sudo apt install ./morpheflow_2.4.1-1_amd64.deb
sudo systemctl enable --now morpheflow
# Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Option C — `.rpm` (Fedora/RHEL)**:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./morpheflow-2.4.1-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo systemctl enable --now morpheflow
```

**Option D — AppImage (portable, x86_64)**:

```bash
chmod +x MorpheFlow-2.4.1-x86_64.AppImage
./MorpheFlow-2.4.1-x86_64.AppImage   # needs system python3 (>=3.11) + Java 21
```

**Option E — Arch Linux (AUR, [`morpheflow-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/morpheflow-git))**:

```bash
yay -S morpheflow-git          # or: paru -S morpheflow-git
sudo systemctl enable --now morpheflow
```

No AUR helper? Build directly from this repo (same sources as the AUR package):

```bash
cd packaging/aur
makepkg -si   # needs base-devel + git; never run makepkg as root
```

The AUR packaging (`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO` + `morpheflow.install`)
mirrors the `.deb`/`.rpm` layout: code in `/opt/morpheflow`, venv + `morphe.jar`
created once by the install scriptlet, state in `/var/lib/morpheflow`.
It is published as a `-git` package tracking `main` because upstream
publishes no version tags yet; `.SRCINFO` is regenerated with
`makepkg --printsrcinfo` before each AUR push.

**Build packages locally**:

```bash
./packaging/build.sh --version 2.4.1 --arch amd64   # .deb + .rpm into dist/
./packaging/appimage/build-appimage.sh --version 2.4.1
```

Service layout: code in `/opt/morpheflow`, state in `/var/lib/morpheflow`,
logs via `journalctl -u morpheflow`. Python venv is created at `/opt/morpheflow/.venv`
and the Morphe patcher jar is fetched once by the post-install script
(`packaging/postinst.sh`). Uninstalling the package keeps `/var/lib/morpheflow` data.
